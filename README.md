# Workshop React Testing

- 2 components are written without tests
- Main component has only tests

Goal: **working in pairs, complete missing tests & main component**

### Tests tips:
- Describe in tests the *behaviour* and not the code
- Big setup & small tests: every test should have 1-2 *expects*
- Use unit tests scarce and mostly for complex function, otherwise integrations

### Code tips:
- The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that
- A boolean should start with one of the: *is, has, should*
- Functions should be verbs and variables nouns
